- As things are searched for they get put in a list on the left so they are
  easy to reaccess.  Hotkeys to get to them as well.  Possibly even permanently
  assign various hotkeys to various items.
- When restoring state from a previous session, possibly the permanently mapped
  plus others depending on lookup frequency.

- Ability to split it (up to 3+ times) vertically so that you can look at
  multiple areas of the same page.

- Easily integrated into vim tags / autocomplete, etc.  Especially cool if it
  could give weight to ones that you looked up more recently.

- Detailed, easy search, based on stemmed word cores as a first pass then
  levenshtein distance

- Common, easy way to generate stuff

- Hidden private by default but expandable

- Very easy to integrate standalone documentation with inline (javadoc) type
  documentation and even literate coding.

- Integrates with compiler-level documentation tools, like python docstrings, 

* Someone else's library/framework (polygonal, rails, anything on github...)
* Language reference (as3, haxe, erlang, efene, c, etc.)
* Gems, python libs, anything that has python documentation built into the
  class itself...
* Man pages / one-off utilities + command-line references
* Your own libraries
* Your own code as it evolves (constantly changing, even real-time?)



Priorities:
- Efene
- Erlang
- AS3
- HaXe
- Erlish


Quite possibly a suped up manpage reader and then tools to turn more "modern"
doc types into manpages...
